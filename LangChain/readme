Create Folder, open CMD cd /d C:/Folder
npm install langchain , langchain-core and langgraph install all dependencies
install webpack
run npx webpack thru webpack.config.js
it generates a new langgraph.bundle.mjs -> put new in Unity folder Assets/Resources/ 



Unity C# Scripts/IntiliazePuerts.cs calls Resources/testLangGraph.mjs which runs langgraph.bundle.mjs

Edit webpack.config.js and src/index.ts for custom code 

Index.ts is the TS script that ccontrolls LangGraph. You can add other files thru webpack 

Scripts/PicoDialogue.cs is an example of User Input with UI and OnSendButtonClicked()  runs user input thru InitializePuerts.Instance.ProcessUserInput(playerInput);  InitializePuerts.cs which calls testLangGraph.mjs which runs LangGranph on langgranph.bundle.mjs
